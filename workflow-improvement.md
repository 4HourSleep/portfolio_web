# Workflow Improvement with Git

## Before Git
- Managing file versions manually was cumbersome.
- Difficult to track changes and revert to previous versions.
- Collaboration required manual file synchronization, leading to errors.

## After Git
- Version control became systematic and efficient.
- Regular commits provided a clear history of the project.
- Branching allowed for parallel feature development and bug fixing.
- Improved collaboration with a centralized repository on GitHub.
